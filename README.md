# Introduction
<h3>
Hello! Thanks for reading my project!
</h3>

<p>The idea of this project is to calculate the value of the daily rate for a specific schadule's range. I use Mysql to store all the daily expenses prices.</p>
<p>The program also have CRUD so you do not have to make any changes using MySql interface.</p>
<p>This is my very first program, that I created in order to help my parents' hotel.</p>
<p>If you find any bugs or have sugestions, please give me a feedback in my e-mail adress: benni.vichel@hotmail.com
</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

# How it Works

<p>
The end customer will choose a start date and an end date in the program.</p>
<p>The program will fetch the values ​​on the specified date and return them to the customer's screen.</p>

## Sections

 ### Section 1 (valores)

![section 1](https://github.com/benjaminvichel/CSharp-Calculate-Hotel-Daily-Rate/assets/84679587/05af85bc-47ae-4e22-892f-5dbdb66a7a59)

<p>In this section, we have the attributes:</p>
<p>double room</p>
<p>luxury double room</p>
<p>single value</p>
<p>triple room</p>
<p>quadruple room</p>
<p>quintuple room</p>

<p>The "single value" is not the value for a room with single bed, but it's the value the program uses to calculate the cost for the triple,quadruple and quintuple rooms</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">Example:</p>

![example](images/example.png)

<p>In the image the double room value is R$ 420,00. Adding the "single value(solteiro)" with the "double room value(casal)" we get the "triple room value(triplo)".</p>
<p>double room (420,00)+ single value(100,00) = triple room (520,00).</p>
<p>We do exactly the same thing to quadruple and quintuple rooms.</p>

### Section 2 (Quarto customizado)
<p>In section 1 we only have room prices for guests over 10 years old. To find out the value of, for example, a triple room with a couple and a child, we use section 2.</p>

![section 2](images/section%202.png)

<p>Add the amount in each field and click the calculate daily rate button(calcular diárias).</p>
<p>The base value in section 2 will always be the value of the double room.</p>

### Section 3 (Quarto customizado)
<p>In section 3 the calculated number of daily rates will be shown</p>
