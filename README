INTRODUCTION:

Hello! Thanks for reading my project!

The idea of this project is to calculate the value of the daily rate for a specific schadule's range. I use Mysql to store all the daily expenses prices.
The program also have CRUD so you do not have to make any changes when using MySql interface. 

This is my very first program, that I created in order to help my parents' hotel.
If you find any bugs or have sugestions, please give me a feedback in my e-mail adress: benni.vichel@hotmail.com

Thanks again!


TO KNOW:

Password to acess CRUD = "nathanota10";
